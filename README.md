# Scribe

**Stay in the conversation.**

Scribe is a free, open-source, local-first meeting notes app for macOS. Choose
**Record** and it captures your microphone and Mac system output as separate tracks,
transcribes both sides on your Mac, and keeps the audio, transcript, summary,
actions, and your own notes together in plain files.

## Why Scribe

- **You decide when to record.** Scribe can notice a supported call and offer a
  Record / Not now prompt, but it never starts on its own.
- **Both sides are clear.** Your microphone and system output are
  captured separately for dependable speaker labels.
- **Useful after the call.** Search every note, rename or trash meetings, copy a
  summary, check off action items, add personal context, play the recording, or
  export Markdown.
- **Ask with evidence.** Ask one meeting, a project, or the whole library and
  jump from timestamp citations to the recording. The default assistant runs
  locally; optional Venice, OpenAI, Claude, Grok, and compatible endpoints are
  invoked only after you connect them and press Ask.
- **Turn talk into follow-through.** Keep a decision log, group work by project
  and people, correct speaker names, and draft recap emails, status updates,
  agendas, or task lists without sending anything automatically.
- **Notes that fit the moment.** Choose concise, balanced, detailed, or
  action-focused summaries. Your quick notes guide the result. Scribe offers a
  summary only after you connect a capable local or remote model—never a
  sentence-stitching fallback presented as analysis.
- **The detail behind the summary.** Meeting Notes organize the discussion by
  topic, preserving context, reasoning, concerns, and unresolved questions.
  Copy them as a briefing or include them in a Markdown export. For an older
  meeting, choose **Regenerate to add meeting notes** to refresh its analysis
  with your connected model.
- **Correct the record.** Use **Edit summary** or **Edit notes** to fix names,
  facts, or wording without an AI call. Edits are saved in `summary-edits.md` and `meeting-notes.md`,
  survive regeneration, and appear in search, copied notes, and Markdown exports.
  The original generated analysis remains in `note.md`.
- **Local means local.** No account, bot, telemetry, cloud transcript, hidden
  upload, subscription, or proprietary database.
- **Work and life fit together.** Product reviews, client calls, appointments,
  interviews, school check-ins, and personal projects live in one calm library.

## Supported calls

The **Record** button works with any conferencing app because capture does not
depend on a vendor integration, meeting bot, browser extension, or a specific
helper-process name. Scribe ships with automatic call-prompt profiles for:

- Zoom
- Microsoft Teams (new and classic)
- Google Meet in Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox
- Slack huddles
- FaceTime
- Webex
- Discord

After you explicitly choose Record, Scribe uses Apple's system-output capture
API so audio routed through FaceTime's `avconferenced`, Chromium renderers,
Electron helpers, and similar services is not lost. Other sounds the Mac plays
during the recording—such as notifications or music—can therefore be included;
pause them or use Focus when a clean call track matters.

## Download and install

Open the [latest Scribe release](https://github.com/cmadd21mm/scribe/releases/latest),
download the versioned `Scribe-<version>.dmg`, open it, and drag Scribe into
Applications. The universal download supports both Apple silicon and Intel Macs
running macOS 15 or newer. The first recording asks for:

- Microphone access for your side
- Screen & System Audio Recording for the other side
- Calendar access only if you want automatic meeting titles

After installing 0.2 or newer, choose **Scribe → Check for Updates…** or
**Settings → Check now…**. Scribe verifies the signed update and installs it
over the existing copy; updates are never forced.

The release scripts support Apple Developer ID signing and notarization. Local
builds are ad-hoc signed; macOS may ask you to confirm opening one through
**System Settings → Privacy & Security**. Maintainers can follow the complete
[release checklist](RELEASING.md) for signed public builds and Sparkle updates.

## Build it yourself

You need macOS 15+, Xcode 16+, and Swift 6.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cmadd21mm/scribe.git
cd scribe
swift test
sh scripts/build-app.sh
open dist/Scribe.app
```

Create a drag-to-Applications installer:

```sh
sh scripts/package-dmg.sh
```

For a signed build, set `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`. To notarize the DMG, also set
`APPLE_NOTARY_PROFILE` to a configured `notarytool` keychain profile.

## First-run setup and speaker names

The setup guide prepares transcription, walks through a temporary 15-second
microphone and Mac-audio test, and offers optional summary configuration.
Downloads can be cancelled and retried. Choose audio-only mode if you want to
record before preparing transcription. **Finish setup** on Home resumes
unfinished setup; **Settings → Review setup and test audio…** reopens it.

Enter your name during setup or in Settings to label your microphone track in
new recordings. In a meeting, click any speaker label or **Name speakers** to
name the call track, listen to individual moments, and tag who spoke. Calendar
attendees and saved meeting people appear as suggestions you confirm. Speaker
names are preserved in readable transcripts and future AI context.

Scribe does not receive Zoom or Teams account identities from Mac audio and
does not automatically separate multiple voices on the call track. Use a
single name for that track only for a one-person remote conversation; use
individual tags when several people are speaking.

For local summaries, choose **On-device Scribe → Use an installed local summary
model**, then select a `llama.cpp` executable and a compatible GGUF model.
**Test connection** uses synthetic text, never an existing meeting. You can
also choose a remote provider with your own API key or continue with
transcripts only. Configuration and a successful connection test are distinct;
model quality still depends on the model you choose.

## Local transcription and summaries

Transcription uses FluidAudio's local Parakeet models. Settings offers English
(recommended), multilingual, and compact choices with explicit installed,
selected, and downloading states. Download one once from Scribe Settings, or
explicitly from Terminal:

```sh
scribe models download-transcription --model parakeet-v2
```

To redo one meeting with a different model or language, open its ⋯ menu and
choose **Transcribe Again With**. Only the transcript is replaced; choose
**Refresh notes** afterward to update the summary.

For Tagalog, Filipino, and Taglish meetings, choose **Whisper Filipino**, which
is Whisper large-v3 turbo running locally through WhisperKit. When it is
selected, Settings shows a **Spoken language** choice: Filipino (the default),
English, or Detect automatically. Whisper is slower than Parakeet and less
accurate on English-only meetings.

```sh
scribe models download-transcription --model whisper-large-v3-turbo
```

Normal recording and transcription make no network requests. The transcript is
available without any AI connection. Summaries, decisions, action items, and
open questions remain unavailable until you connect an optional locally
installed `llama.cpp` model or explicitly configure a remote provider.

Ask Scribe also works locally with timestamped retrieval. Optional remote AI
connections use an API key stored in the Mac Keychain. Scribe can fetch the
text models available to that key from Venice AI, OpenAI, Claude, Grok/xAI, or
a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint and presents them in a searchable picker;
manual model IDs remain available for private endpoints. Ordinary ChatGPT,
Claude, Grok, or Venice subscriptions may not include API access. Scribe sends
only the selected context after the user asks a question, redacts common
contact details by default, and sets `store: false` for OpenAI requests.

## Your files

The default folder is `~/Recordings`. Every conversation is an ordinary,
Obsidian-friendly folder:

```text
2026-08-17 1002 - Product planning/
├── mic.caf
├── system.caf
├── meta.json
├── transcript.json
├── transcript.md
├── note.md
├── user-notes.md
├── action-state.json
├── speaker-names.json
├── speaker-overrides.json
└── scribe-context.json
```

Incomplete recordings are recovered on the next launch. A free-space check runs
before capture, and metadata is written atomically as recording state changes.

## Configuration

Preferences are written to `~/.config/scribe/config.json`.

```json
{
  "recordings_dir": "~/Recordings",
  "prompt_for_calls": true,
  "call_prompt_delay_seconds": 8,
  "minimum_free_disk_gb": 2,
  "mic_voice_processing": false,
  "transcription": {
    "enabled": true,
    "engine": "parakeet",
    "model": "parakeet-v2"
  },
  "intelligence": {
    "provider": "local",
    "redact_sensitive": true
  }
}
```

For Filipino transcription, set `"engine": "whisper"`,
`"model": "whisper-large-v3-turbo"`, and `"language"` to `"tl"`, `"en"`, or
`"auto"`.

Set `prompt_for_calls` to `false` if you want Scribe to wait quietly for you to
press Record. This setting never enables automatic recording.

## Command line

The app includes an optional CLI for automation and diagnostics:

```sh
scribe run
scribe start --bundle-id us.zoom.xos --title "Customer interview"
scribe stop
scribe apps
scribe doctor
scribe transcribe <meeting-folder>
scribe note <meeting-folder>
scribe recover
scribe models download-transcription --model parakeet-v2
```

Control commands use local distributed notifications and do not contact a
server.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md), and the
real-Mac [manual test checklist](MANUAL-TEST.md). CI runs the Swift test suite,
checks that runtime code has no network path beyond the explicit model command,
and builds a signed application artifact.
